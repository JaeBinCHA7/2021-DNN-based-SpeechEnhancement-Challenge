# Speech_enhancement_with_DCCRN
You can do DNN-based SE using a complex network through this repository. First, you can make noisy data by mixing clean speech and noise, and then you can generate a dataset with those data. (If you already have a dataset, skip this.) The dataset is used for deep learning training, and the type and configuration of the model can be adjusted in various ways, if you want. And, the result of the network can be evaluated through various objective metrics (PESQ, STOI, CSIG, CBAK, COVL).
